      <h2>Making the canvas application</h2>
      <p>
        So we have learnt about how to make classes, event
        listeners as well as manipulate DOM elements - now
        we are going to practice combining all these
        elements and use it to make a canvas application.
        More specifically, this will function as your base
        if you decide that you want to work on frontend
        animation libraries, as many animation libraries
        such as Three.js and Greensock utilize canvas. This
        project will also strengthen your problem solving
        skills - often times, when you want to create
        something, you have to figure out HOW to do it, and
        ensuring that you plan out your logic well is
        quintessential in building an effective and
        organized application.
      </p>

            Users will be able to draw on the application,
            and upload it onto the webpage. This application
            will function as a way for users to practice
            self-expression.

                Please please be sure to practice pulling
                and pushing before starting. Github branches
                are a hassle to fix.</strong
              >
            </li>
            <li>
              Look at how the code is structured (look in
              the examples folder) - more specifically, how
              are other people creating their application?
              What are the differences? What is easiest for
              me to understand? I attached some notes below
              as to what this process may look like.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  There's a parent class - mouseMethods,
                  that is extended by the other classes
                  (remember, that means that other classes
                  can utilize the methods in mouseMethods) -
                  you don't necessarily need to use this
                  kind of implementation in designing your
                  application
                </li>
                <li>
                  Each button is connected to a class, and
                  we pass in two canvas inside each - why?
                </li>
                <li>Make notes for yourself</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Create User Interface</li>
        <li></li>
        <li>Create Javascript Classes</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Sidenote: Please implement the canvas application by
        utilizing the Canvas 2D methods - feel free to
        utilize color libraries. The purpose of this
        assignment is to essentially practice your ability
        to read document and implement the methods.
